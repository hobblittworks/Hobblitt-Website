  {
    question: "DO YOU HAVE FIXED PACKAGES?",
    answer:
      "Not really. We price around the problem, scope, and outcome rather than forcing every project into the same package.",

  {
    question: "HOW DO YOU ESTIMATE A PROJECT?",
    answer:
      "We first understand what you are trying to achieve, what is getting in the way, and what needs to change. From there, we define the right scope and engagement.",

    question: "WHAT IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE NEED YET?",

      "That's completely fine. Start with the problem. We help understand what is actually needed before deciding what to build.",

  {
    question: "DO YOU ONLY BUILD PRODUCTS AND WEBSITES?",
    answer:
      "No. Depending on the problem, the right answer might be a product, an internal tool, an integration, an automated workflow, or a broader digital experience.",
  },

  {
    question: "CAN WE START SMALL?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can start with discovery, a focused build, or a specific problem and expand the engagement when the work calls for it.",

    question: "DO YOU WORK WITH STARTUPS AND GROWING BUSINESSES?",

      "Yes. We work with people building what comes next — from early ideas and growing businesses to teams ready to rethink how they work.",

  {
    question: "DO YOU WORK ONGOINGLY?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Some teams need a focused build while others need a long-term technology and creative partner. We can work either way.",

  {
    question: "HOW DO WE GET STARTED?",
    answer:
      "Tell us what is stuck, what you are trying to build, or where you want to go next. We will figure out the right place to start.",
